/// Both getters & setters
// Validate data before read and write private properties.
// Performs some actions before reading & writing properties.
// Both provides controlled access to an object properties.

/// Why Use Getter and Setter
// Help to hide internal representation of an object & expose only what is necessary.
// Use validation to setters to ensure only valid data is assigned to properties.
// Getter can be use to compute values dynamically base on other properties.
